        <h2>What is Seated Acupressure?</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Seated Acupressure is a Meridian based therapy, that requires applying pressure to 
          various acupressure points across the shoulders, back, arms, hands, neck, head, and 
          legs. This approach utilizes gentle methods like pushing, pulling, rocking, shaking, 
          stretching, and mobilization.
